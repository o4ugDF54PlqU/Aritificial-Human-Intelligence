# AHI - the human shortcut to AGI
AHI, or Artificial Human Intelligence, is a long term project to make an AGI by using humans as a base for the bottom up process (rather than the top down approach of a supervised neural net). For details on the design and ideas, please see the wiki. The project is currently in the planning and design stages, so the wiki will be filled up before much of the code is written, though expect demos to be available during this stage as well.
